    <h1>The Birth of Lord Krishna</h1>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Mythological Context and Divine Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The birth of Lord Krishna is one of the most celebrated and revered events in Hindu mythology. Lord Krishna, the eighth incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, was born at a time when the world was in great turmoil. Evil forces, led by the tyrant king Kansa, had spread terror across the land, and the Earth itself was suffering under the weight of sin and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the Bhagavata Purana, Krishna’s birth was predestined as part of the divine plan to rid the world of evil and restore dharma (righteousness). Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, decided to incarnate as Krishna to vanquish these forces of darkness and to guide humanity towards righteousness.
    </p>

    <h2>Birth of Krishna</h2>
    <p>
        Krishna was born in the small town of Mathura, which was then ruled by King Kansa. Kansa, who had seized the throne from his father, was a cruel and evil ruler. It was foretold that Kansa would be killed by the eighth child of his sister, Devaki. Fearing this prophecy, Kansa imprisoned Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, and killed their first six children.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, when Devaki conceived her eighth child, divine intervention ensured that the child would survive. On the night of Krishna’s birth, a series of miracles occurred. Despite the heavily guarded prison, all the guards fell into a deep sleep, the chains binding Vasudeva were loosed, and the doors of the prison opened by themselves. Vasudeva then carried the newborn Krishna across the Yamuna River to the safety of his foster parents, Nanda and Yashoda, in the village of Gokul.

    <h2>Significance of Krishna’s Birth</h2>
    <p>
        Krishna’s birth is celebrated as Janmashtami, one of the most important festivals in the Hindu calendar. It symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the divine protection of the righteous. The stories of Krishna’s life, including his playful childhood in Gokul and his later role in the Mahabharata, have had a profound influence on Hindu culture and spirituality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Krishna’s teachings, particularly those in the Bhagavad Gita, continue to inspire millions around the world. His life and message emphasize the importance of devotion, love, and righteousness, making him one of the most beloved deities in Hinduism.

Shri Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudev, however was brought up by Yashoda 
and Nanda in Vrindavan. The festival generally falls on the Ashtami Tithi of 
Krishna Paksha or 8<sup style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 12px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">th</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>day

The tyrant Kansa, was told by a voice in the sky that one of her children would 
kill him. Kansa decided to kill Devaki so that she does not give rise to any 
children, but Vasudeva, her husband begged Kansa to forgive Devki and promised 
that he will give any of her child to Kansa, so then Kansa on this assurance 
from Vasudev, let Devki go. He imprisoned both Devaki and Vasudeva. Kansa made 
sure that none of her children survived. Therefore, in order to protect lord 
Krishna, his father Vasudev carried him in a basket across the raging River 
Yamuna to Vrindavan. There Krishna was adopted and brought up by Yashoda and 
Nanda.</span></p>
